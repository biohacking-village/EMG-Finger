# Creating you own Muscle Controlled Robotic Finger

If you have ever wanted to get some experience in working with Robotics in a fun and interesting way, this mini project is a great way to get started. This Muscle controlled robotic finger will exposure you to the basics of 3D printing, robotic hand design, arduinos, servos and the basics of biosignals, all interesting subjects on their own. In total the cost for putting one together can be as cheap at 100$-150$ depending on where you source your parts. The best part is that you can reuse the Arduino and servo  and myoware once you are done.

# Assembling your finger

## Step 1 Printing your finger index

Head to Inmoov Finger starter kit to find the STL files. If you don't have a 3d Printer, you can head to a fab lab or makerspace and get it done there. You can also do the printing online and have it shipper to you as well.
